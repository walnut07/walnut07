# Commit Message Rules
This is the rules for my commit messages. I follow them in my personal projects. <br>

## Format
Format: `<type>: <subject>`<br>
`<type>` starts with an uppercase. `<subject>` starts with lowercase, in present tense, and has no period.<br>
Example:
```
Feat: get the title move right upon user's click
```

## Type
* **Feat**: A new feature for user
* **Fix**: A bug fix for user
* **Docs**: Documentation only changes
* **Style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **Refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (remaning a variable, change the place of for loop, etc)
* **Perf**: Changes related to backward-compatible performance improvements
* **Test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **Chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation
